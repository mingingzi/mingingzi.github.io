> “Yeah It's on. ”


## Intro

I had an old portfolio website built with WIX. This year, I'm starting to learn deeper computer graphics (I used to work with Unity ShaderLab). Instead of just presenting my final outcomes with pictures, I'm wishing to post some technical details to explain what I did. However, WIX doesn't allow me to post my code. So I'm decide to build up this blog on my own and migrating everything here.

## How to build your blog with github.io

I used [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) + [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to make this website. It's a very popular way to setup personal blog, and you can find many resources and Jekyll themes online. For example:

* [jekyllthemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/)  
* [jekyll-themes.com](https://jekyll-themes.com/)
* [mademistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/)

[This](https://github.com/huxpro/huxpro.github.io/) is the theme I'm using. If you want to use this theme, you need to 1. install Ruby, 2. install jekyll, 3. register GitHub and create GitHub Pages, 4. follow the instructions provided in the link.

The most difficult part is setting up the environment. It took me three hours to figure things out(obviously I have no experience with web stuff), but it definitely worths it!

## How to maintain your blog

I'm using [Prose](http://prose.io "prose") to update blogs.

Pros: It can directly push your .markdown files to GitHub repository, and the blog will be updated on your website immediately. Some formatting tools are very handy.

Cons: The Review mode is buggy. Sometimes my code is correct on the website, but the Review mode shows messy formatting.

[Here](http://www.websbytodd.com/documentation/using-prose/#save-and-publish-your-post) is a tutorial on Prose that I find very useful.

## In the end
I'll post my works, lifes and blogs here. That's it.
